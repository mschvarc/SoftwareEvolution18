## Aggregated Metrics
For each atomic metric described above we can derive aggregated metrics using at least two or more atomic metrics. 
We assign a numeric value to each SIG rating (5 = `++`, 1 = `--`) and use arithmentic average of the individual ratings to derive the aggregated metric. 
The numeric rating is then converted in reverse to the SIG rating. 

The SIG ratings can be converted to ISO 9126 maintainability ratings by taking the average of multiple SIG metrics.
